		<p> Valley of Fire, Nevada state park. It's a very beautiful place, even though the main color is actually more of a rusty red
		and the name of it sounds a little... <em><bold>dark.</bold></em> If you are looking to improve your freehand rock climbing 
		skills, this is the place for you (as long as you're fairly new to freehand rock climbing... otherwise this lovely place will be
		a little too easy for you)! It has amazing sights, as seen in the picture above, and there are great camping spots.</p>
